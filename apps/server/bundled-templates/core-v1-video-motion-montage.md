# Montage

Use when several distinct shots, assets, places, or viewpoints must accumulate into one idea. Do not use montage merely to make a static list feel faster.

## Semantic roles

- `[data-motion-role="shot"]` — one independently readable visual moment.
- `[data-motion-role="bridge"]` — an optional shared detail, direction, or shape that preserves continuity.
- `[data-motion-role="motif"]` — a recurring visual anchor across shots.
- `[data-motion-role="resolve"]` — the final image or statement that explains why the shots belong together.

## Registry candidates

Prefer `device-carousel`, `picture-in-picture`, `media-hero`, or `split-screen` when their media structure fits. A montage normally combines at least three shot or focus changes. Install each selected component once and keep one host-owned project timeline.

## Beat grammar

- **Establish:** introduce the motif and first complete shot long enough to orient the viewer.
- **Develop:** alternate or accumulate shots at semantic or measured audio boundaries. Preserve one continuity cue across each change.
- **Land:** reduce the cut rate, hold the strongest image, and reveal the shared conclusion.

## Execution contract

Give every shot its own beat and target. Use `component:` for a component's native reveal, then `preset:` or `custom:` references for later shot changes. A shot change must alter the visible subject, crop, viewpoint, or information state; moving the same card a few pixels does not count. Avoid more than two consecutive cuts with identical duration unless a measured musical pulse requires it.

When a shot lasts longer than four seconds, add internal focus, crop, annotation, or state development. Do not hide an unfinished asset behind a rapid cut. Use a direct cut for energetic continuity and a short fade or content reveal only when meaning changes.

## Acceptance

- At least three shot or focal states are observable at direct-seek checkpoints.
- Every cut has a content or audio reason recorded by its beat intent.
- The sequence preserves one motif or directional relationship and lands on a readable conclusion.
- No shot is blank, placeholder-only, or repeated solely to fill duration.
