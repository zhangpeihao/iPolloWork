# Progressive Build

Use when ordered parts create a process, model, argument, or final structure. Do not use for independent items that can be understood in any order.

## Semantic roles

- `[data-motion-role="context"]` — optional orientation that remains available.
- `[data-motion-role="part"]` — repeated units in narration order.
- `[data-motion-role="connector"]` — lines or relationships revealed with their dependent part.
- `[data-motion-role="conclusion"]` — the resolved model or takeaway.

## Registry candidates

Use `shotcraft-card-stack` when exactly eight real images form the sequence. Otherwise author the progressive build in the active scene, with editable content and an inherited theme. Bind each reveal and the final resolution to narration beats.

## Temporal states

- **Establish:** show context and the first meaningful part.
- **Develop:** add parts and their connectors in narration order while preserving useful prior context.
- **Land:** show the complete structure, reduce incidental emphasis, and reveal the conclusion.

## Timeline recipe

Append to the existing paused project timeline. Replace selectors and timing with the real scene instance and narration beats.

```js
const sceneStart = 12;
const buildStart = sceneStart + 0.25;
const parts = gsap.utils.toArray("#scene-model [data-motion-role='part']");

tl.fromTo("#scene-model [data-motion-role='context']",
  { opacity: 0, y: 24 },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.55, ease: "power3.out" },
  buildStart);

parts.forEach((part, index) => {
  const at = buildStart + 0.55 + index * 0.9;
  tl.fromTo(part,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0.92 },
    { opacity: 1, scale: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "back.out(1.3)" },
    at);
  tl.fromTo(`#scene-model [data-motion-role='connector'][data-motion-index='${index}']`,
    { opacity: 0, scaleX: 0, transformOrigin: "left center" },
    { opacity: 1, scaleX: 1, duration: 0.45, ease: "power2.inOut" },
    at + 0.25);
});

tl.fromTo("#scene-model [data-motion-role='conclusion']",
  { opacity: 0, y: 18 },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.55, ease: "power2.out" },
  buildStart + 0.7 + parts.length * 0.9);
```

## Adaptation

- Tie each part to a narration beat instead of using equal spacing when audio exists.
- Keep earlier parts visible when they are needed to understand the whole. Dim them only when the current step requires stronger focus.
- For dense material, split the build across scenes rather than shrinking the complete model.

## Acceptance

- Direct seeks before and after every part boundary show a stable accumulated state.
- The Land frame contains the intended complete structure and conclusion.
- The scene does not reveal every part during the opening second and then remain unchanged.
