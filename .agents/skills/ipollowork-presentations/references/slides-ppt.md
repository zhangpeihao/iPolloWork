# Slides and Native PPT Rules

Applies to iPolloWork presentations and native editable PPT. Consult applicable sections of the [shared guidelines](shared-guidelines.md) when the task needs creative, media or verification policy. This reference adds PPT authoring and acceptance requirements; the selected mode, injected session contract and actual export capabilities remain implementation boundaries. Read the [layout guide](layout.md) only when selecting or recomposing structures, then open only relevant source layouts.

Status: authoring guidance, not proof of automatic injection into every engine or automated enforcement of every check. Do not claim experience or export verification without performing the relevant rendering and export checks.

## 1. Determine task scope

Read by scope: copy/selected-object edits use the current source and affected typography/mode rules; theme-only edits use scope, tokens and actual font-fit checks. Neither requires layout catalogs or media guidance for unchanged assets and structure. Creation, narrative rewrites and structural work use the applicable narrative/layout sections and shared creative policy. Asset work uses shared media policy; initial/full authoring plans needs before layout and checks outcomes after placement. A local/theme edit with unchanged media and valid existing assets requires no new media plan or generation request. Read acceptance guidance when delivering; preserve host gates and reuse completed checks unless their inputs change.

| Task | Allowed changes | Preserve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial generation | Determine count/order from content; reuse, repeat, combine, remove or extend template patterns | Explicit constraints, visual identity, fixed canvas, runtime and editable contracts |
| Narrative rewrite or full redesign | Reorder, add/remove or rebuild pages within the request | Valid facts, assets, user edits and style not authorized to change |
| Targeted edit | Edit specified pages/objects and adjust layout within those pages when necessary | Unrelated pages, content, order and objects; shared CSS must not affect them |
| Theme-only change | Update semantic tokens and check real rendering | Page count/order, content, assets, canvas, object positions and editable markers |

Initial generation does not inherit the template's sample count, narrative or brand data. If a theme change causes font overflow, first check font mappings and typography parameters. Explain any remaining conflict requiring object rearrangement rather than silently moving objects. Resolve exact-layout versus complete-content conflicts under the shared guidelines.

## 2. Read the brief and plan the narrative

- Read the current entry, confirmed requirements, existing pages, tokens, template guide and applicable layout index. Load only relevant candidates.
- Identify audience, purpose, language, setting, main conclusion, evidence and delivery format from existing materials. Proceed when sufficient; ask only about consequential gaps.
- Content and explicit user constraints determine page count. Speaking time can inform pacing, not a fixed minutes-per-slide quota. Examples and capacity hints are not hard page-count requirements.
- Plan each page's message, content relationship, evidence and asset purpose. Check reusable assets and gaps, query capabilities under the shared rules, then select or create a layout. This plan guides execution; do not require approval of internal IDs or an outline unless the user requests it.
- Give each slide one main reading task. Prefer headings that state a conclusion or question, supported by evidence. Use section pages when useful, not mandatory agenda, transition or thank-you pages merely to fill a formula.
- Separate facts, assumptions and missing information. Replace/remove example figures, logos and testimonials rather than presenting them as real user outcomes.

## 3. Select and extend layouts

Select structure by content relationship, then use [layout.md](layout.md) for the current core-v1 selection map, source fragments, slots, capacity and variants. Shared catalog, template-local patterns and new structures are all valid sources; catalog membership is preferred reuse rather than a whitelist.

- Read the real candidate source and CSS dependencies. Copy only the selected structural fragment and scoped styles, omitting preview hosts, scripts, sample themes and fonts.
- Replace sample content first, then adjust columns, proportions, image/text areas and optional slots. Repeating a pattern is useful for comparable material; variation needs a content reason.
- If no pattern fits, extend the active typography, graphic and spacing language. Give the new structure a meaningful `data-layout` ID, but do not register or claim it as a verified global layout automatically.
- Preserve unique slide/object identifiers and recognized `data-ipw-slide` roots. Fixed-canvas extensions must resolve actual overflow through structure, space or page splitting rather than viewport reflow or hidden clipping.

## 4. Capacity and Chinese typography

- Retain the supported fixed 16:9 canvas; do not add mobile stacking or breakpoint reflow. Check product support before adopting another requested ratio.
- Use coherent roles for headings, body, notes and sources. Choose sizes, leading and whitespace for the template and viewing scale, not chat typography or a generic website scale.
- For dense content, tighten nonessential wording, adjust space or choose another structure; split if page constraints permit. Do not shrink all text, compress leading, clip content or omit essential facts to force a fit.
- Inspect long Chinese titles for semantic breaks, glyph collisions, orphans and distance from body text. `text-wrap: balance` is only an aid. Check font fallback, values/units and long Latin words in mixed text.
- Charts must be readable at presentation scale, with visible sources and necessary notes. Do not encode important distinctions with color alone.
- Review reading order among title, body, image and source, and consistency of margins/density across pages. No overflow does not imply good layout.

### Capacity planning and overflow handling

Use the selected catalog/local source as the capacity owner. Trial the longest title and densest page first with the actual font, line height, slots and image ratio; capacity is not a universal character count. When no specification exists, a 1280×720 trial baseline is 40–56px headings, 24–30px body and supporting text at least 18px, scaled for other canvases and confirmed visually. Reallocate space, change structure or split pages when content exceeds the trial; do not invent verified limits or create a one-task library.

### Contrast and line-break review

- Check actual backgrounds behind text, including photos, gradients, color edges and overlays. Target at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Large means at least 24px regular or about 19px bold at actual display scale, not a magnified screenshot. Check the least favorable image region; move text or add a theme-consistent stable backing when needed. Comparing token values alone is insufficient.
- Break Chinese headings semantically and avoid body endings with only 1–2 characters or punctuation. Adjust text width, remove unsuitable hard breaks or change layout before tightening wording without losing meaning/facts. Preserve verbatim copy when requested. Do not shrink the whole slide to eliminate orphans.
- Title, body and notes need distinct regions that fit their real content. Inspect rendered line boxes and following regions; overflowing fixed-height titles must not cover body text. Deliberate layering is acceptable, unreadable text is not.

## 5. Theme and assets

Native editable PPT can contain `data-pptx-image` objects. Editability covers supported properties such as position and size; every image pixel need not become a vector object. Do not omit appropriate imagery to guarantee editability. Routine supporting imagery follows the shared automatic-selection policy: use a suitable authorized saved preference or `defaultModel`, and ask only when the user requests a choice or provider, cost or capability differences materially affect the task. Multiple available models alone must not leave an image-dependent page pending or cause a downgrade to shapes.

A text-only attachment or geometric template example is not an instruction to omit imagery. Use the active image-generation Skill or exposed action even when Image Studio is closed, and verify saved files and placement. Generated illustrations cannot replace real evidence. Saved custom templates, editable uploads, screenshot-only references and fully custom briefs supply different evidence; follow the shared source/layout-freedom rules without claiming unsupported import or export fidelity.

- Retain a selected template's visual identity unless restyling is explicitly requested; a changed audience alone is not authorization.
- Use current semantic tokens and preserve the `design-tokens.css` contract. Do not restore sample colors, add inline theme overrides or import another global theme.
- Follow the shared media workflow once for the deck; do not add per-slide model-selection or assessment loops. Visual slots may contain images, editable charts or shapes, and sample geometry is not a fixed asset requirement. Use `data-pptx-image` for supported editable image objects.
- Check resolution, crop, proportion and image/text relationships. HTML playback does not establish media support in the requested PPT format; verify actual export support before embedding.
- Save files/assets in the current `design/<session-id>/` and reuse existing asset directories; do not create a parallel project.

## 6. Editing, playback, notes and motion by mode

### Native Editable PPT

- Preserve supported `data-pptx-text`, `data-pptx-shape` and `data-pptx-image` markers on objects that need editable export, following the injected visible-object coverage contract.
- Give each element one PPTX object type. A text card uses a shape container and separate marked text children, not shape/text markers on the same node. Check exported text per page; object counts alone do not prove completeness.
- Use explicit supported shape nodes for meaningful decoration, not unmarked pseudo-elements. Browser visibility does not prove PPTX inclusion.
- Keep object geometry simple and measurable. Do not assume lossless export of complex DOM/CSS, or flatten editable text/shapes/pages into screenshots.
- The Design panel owns navigation. Do not add scripts, keyboard handlers, page controls, navigation buttons or speaker-note nodes, and do not transplant OpenDesign's runtime.
- Keep every native slide root intrinsically renderable. Do not hide non-first `[data-ipw-slide]` roots with `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, zero opacity or equivalent source rules; the Design panel isolates the selected page.
- Do not add animation frameworks or promise PPTX animation retention by default. Verify support for requested effects, explaining unsupported cases and feasible alternatives.
- Use actual supported notes functionality. If notes cannot be embedded, provide a separate script when requested and state that it is not inside the PPTX.

### HTML Presentation

- Retain the template's supported fixed canvas, keyboard navigation, controls and notes contract; do not add a second runtime.
- Add speaker notes only when supported and needed. Keep presenter guidance separate from audience-visible content.
- Use existing motion to explain sequence/emphasis, usually with one clear focus per page; do not animate everything mechanically. Verify navigation, replay and screenshots do not leave content invisible.
- Working HTML playback is not verified editable PPTX export. Identify the actual delivered format.

## 7. Generation and acceptance loop

Follow read → asset assessment and required capability queries → page planning and layout selection/extension → asset generation, saving and placement → inspect/repair → deliver.

1. **Content:** compare the page plan with user materials; verify narrative, facts, units, sources and essential conditions. Replace sample content and list required gaps.
2. **Structure:** use existing validators for fixed canvas, slide roots, identifiers, resource references and marker coverage. Template-package acceptance follows the shared contract separately and does not replace artifact-experience checks. Distinguish shared reuse, local reuse and extensions instead of enforcing a global ID whitelist. Positioning/overflow checks identify candidates; actual clipping, obstruction, canvas violations or lost editability justify repairs.
   **Assets:** verify decisions, actual required queries, generated/reused results and actual references. Replacing absent source photos with geometry without required queries leaves the media workflow incomplete. Prefer editable data/process diagrams; do not accept or reject by image count.
3. **Deck overview:** call `media/artifact_preview_review` with the active `sourcePath` and `kind="slides"`. The client loads fonts and hydrated project assets, activates every recognized slide in one batch and reports blank or hidden surfaces, broken resources and horizontal overflow. A counted slide root with an empty rendered surface is a failure.
4. **Focused review:** use the Design client surface for human inspection of representative and programmatically flagged slides when needed. Always include the cover, densest slide, final slide, new layouts and slides with long Chinese titles, charts or media. Do not navigate and capture every slide as separate tool calls, start a server, create a helper page, or use generic browser screenshots. The single batch action owns mechanical whole-deck coverage.
5. **Client experience:** exercise the affected editor capabilities once. For native PPT, verify representative text, shape and image edits; for HTML, verify navigation and affected notes/motion. A targeted content-only change does not require repeating unrelated editor checks.
6. **Requested export or formal acceptance:** use the supported product path and inspect actual PPTX/PDF/image files when requested or when the user explicitly asks for strict/full acceptance. PPTX needs both visual and editability checks; markers, filenames or HTML captures alone prove neither. If no model-callable client export exists, preserve editable source and direct the user accurately to client export. Do not scan/install tools or reconstruct approximate layouts as a substitute for native export.
7. **Repair and recheck:** collect page issues, apply one consolidated repair pass and rerender affected slides together. Fix obscured/unreadable content before orphans, spacing and rhythm. A shared-style/token change triggers one batched whole-deck recheck. One additional targeted repair is allowed for remaining must-fix defects; optional polish must not create an open-ended loop.

If client, rendering or export access is missing, preserve artifacts and distinguish checked, unverified and unfinished work. Source checks are not real-experience verification. Essential missing content, broken resources, obstruction or lost required editability are must-fix issues under the shared rules.

Deliver the current entry, actual completed exports and a short explanation. Never list unperformed exports as results. Nontechnical users do not need internal layout IDs, object markers or complete validation logs.

## References and maintenance

OpenDesign's [PPT authoring workflow](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design/blob/main/design-templates/html-ppt/references/authoring-guide.md) and [PPT Skill](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design/blob/main/design-templates/html-ppt/SKILL.md) informed requirements gathering, theme/layout separation, page-level authoring and browser review. These rules are rewritten for iPolloWork's native editing, theme and export constraints; they do not copy template code or runtime.

Maintain cross-type principles in the shared contract and PPT-specific rules here. The [layout guide](layout.md) describes reusable core-v1 structures; template-local patterns belong in `authoring.md`. OpenDesign's mandatory adjacent-layout changes, fixed speaking/page-count suggestions, presentation runtime and decorative animation requirements are not iPolloWork defaults. Automatic injection and real-model execution require separate verification; updated documents alone do not prove every engine follows them.
